                                Design has always been my way of connecting with people. From the early days of my career, I understood that great design isn’t just about aesthetics—it’s about empathy, problem-solving, and creating experiences that make a real difference in people’s lives. This mindset has shaped every project I’ve led, from redesigning websites to crafting complex design systems.

                                My Master's in Multimedia and Audio-Visual Production from the University of Bucharest wasn't just about technology; it was about understanding people and crafting narratives that resonate. This foundation honed my eye for detail and instilled a deep-seated empathy for user needs – skills that translate beautifully into user-centered design.

                                As a UI/UX Designer, I spearheaded the redesign of their entire website. This wasn't just aesthetics; it was about crafting a more intuitive and engaging experience. I meticulously crafted high-fidelity designs, ensuring every element aligned with user expectations. Translating these designs into functional realities using HTML/CSS in ASP.NET showcased my technical skill and ability to bridge the gap between creativity and practicality.

                                Leading a team of seven talented designers on landing page projects, my role was not just to design but to drive meaningful business results. One of my proudest achievements was crafting <span>over 100 landing pages annually</span> for marketing campaigns. These pages, coupled with newsletters and banners, generated exceptional leads across diverse channels. I designed key visual concepts for over ten corporate websites (VeeamON, Modern Data Protection) – each demanding a keen understanding of composition, imagery, color, and typography.

                                At a pivotal moment in Veeam’s growth journey, I had the opportunity to lead the charge in establishing an <span>Efficient Design System</span>. What began as an effort to streamline our design process quickly evolved into something far more impactful. By creating a system that ensured consistency and elevated brand awareness, our team was able to produce higher-quality designs in record time. Using Figma, I crafted both low and high-fidelity prototypes, responsive designs, and reusable components that bridged the gap between concept and execution. The result? Not only enhanced the speed and quality of production but also allowed Veeam to <span>expand its global presence</span> with confidence.

By keeping the lines of <span>communication open and transparent</span>, we were able to move fast from concept to final product, ensuring that the design, functionality, and business objectives were perfectly aligned.
